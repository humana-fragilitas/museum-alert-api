[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/humana-fragilitas/c5e59bb95d53e6062c676cd9b89120a4/raw/coverage-badge.json)](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert/actions)

AWS CDK-based infrastructure for the Museum Alert IoT project, providing cloud services for device management, user authentication, and real-time communication with Arduino-based ultrasonic sensors.

## Related Projects

This infrastructure supports:

- **[Museum Alert Desktop](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert-desktop)**: cross-platform device management application;
- **[Museum Alert Sketch](https://github.com/humana-fragilitas/museum-alert-sketch)**: Arduino firmware for ultrasonic sensors.

## Architecture Overview

This project creates a complete AWS infrastructure stack comprising:

- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints for device and user management;
- **AWS Cognito**: user authentication and authorization services;
- **AWS IoT Core**: device connectivity, message routing, and provisioning;
- **AWS Lambda**: serverless business logic and event processing;
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing company and device data;
- **CloudWatch**: logging, monitoring, and alerting.

## Prerequisites

‚ö†Ô∏è **Please read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) before using this project.**

### System Requirements
- **Node.js**: version 22.12.0 or higher;
- **AWS CLI**: version 2.16.12 or higher, configured with appropriate credentials;
- **AWS CDK**: version 2.1022.0 or higher.

### AWS Account Setup

#### 1. Create IAM User for CDK Deployment

1. **Log into AWS Console** ‚Üí Go to **IAM service**
2. **Create a new IAM user**:

   - enter username (e.g., "museum-alert-dev");
   - select "Attach policies directly";
   - attach "AdministratorAccess" policy (for development);
   - click "Create user".
3. **Generate Access Keys**:
   - click on the username ‚Üí "Security credentials";
   - click "Create access key" ‚Üí Choose "Command Line Interface (CLI)";
   - **Save the credentials securely** - you won't see the secret key again!

## Configuration Output

After successful deployment, the system provides ready-to-use configuration for client applications:

### Angular/Desktop Application Configuration

```javascript
// Copy this from deployment output to src/environments/environment.*.ts
export const APP_CONFIG = {
  production: false,
  environment: 'DEV',
  aws: {
    apiGateway: 'https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev',
    region: 'eu-west-2',
    algorithm: 'AWS4-HMAC-SHA256',
    IoTCore: {
      endpoint: 'xxxxxxxxxx-ats.iot.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com',
      service: 'iotdevicegateway'
    },
    amplify: {
      Auth: {
        Cognito: {
          userPoolId: 'eu-west-2_xxxxxxxxx',
          userPoolClientId: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
          identityPoolId: 'eu-west-2:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx',
          mandatorySignIn: true,
          authenticationFlowType: 'USER_SRP_AUTH'
        }
      }
    }
  },
  settings: {
    MQTT_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT: 10000,
    USB_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT: 10000,
  }
};
```

### Arduino Sketch Configuration

```cpp
// Copy this to config.h in the Arduino sketch
namespace AWS {
  static constexpr const char* IOT_CORE_ENDPOINT = "xxxxxxxxxx-ats.iot.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com";
}
```

![Configuration Output](./docs/images/configuration_output.png)

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment (`dev`)
- **Region**: `eu-west-2` (Europe - London)
- **Purpose**: Testing and development
- **Features**: Debug logging, auto-cleanup on destroy
- **Cost**: Minimal (pay-per-use resources)

## Development Workflow

### 1. Preview Changes
```bash
# See what would change before deploying
npm run diff:dev
```

### 2. Deploy to Development
```bash
# Deploy all stacks
npm run deploy:dev
```

### 3. Test Your Changes
- Use the configuration outputs to test with client applications;
- verify API endpoints and IoT functionality.

### 5. Cleanup Development Resources
```bash
# Remove all development resources
npm run destroy:dev
```

## Monitoring and Logging

The infrastructure includes comprehensive monitoring:

- **CloudWatch Logs**: All Lambda functions and API Gateway
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: API Gateway performance and Lambda execution
- **IoT Logging**: Device connection and message flow
- **Access Logs**: API Gateway request/response logging

## Cost Optimization

### Development Environment
- **DynamoDB**: Pay-per-request (minimal cost for testing)
- **Lambda**: Free tier eligible
- **API Gateway**: Pay-per-request
- **IoT Core**: Pay-per-message

## Security Features

- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege access principles
- **Cognito Authentication**: JWT token-based API access
- **IoT Policies**: Device-specific permissions
- **VPC Integration**: Optional for enhanced security
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bootstrap Required**:
   ```bash
   npm run bootstrap:dev
   ```

2. **Permission Denied**:
   - Verify AWS credentials and IAM permissions
   - Check AWS profile configuration

3. **Stack Dependency Errors**:
   - Stacks have built-in dependency management
   - Use `npm run destroy:dev` and redeploy if needed

4. **Region Mismatch**:
   - Ensure AWS CLI region matches environment configuration
   - Dev: `eu-west-2`

### Cleanup Failed Deployments

```bash
# List all stacks
aws cloudformation list-stacks --region eu-west-2 --profile cdk-deploy

# Force cleanup if needed
npm run destroy:dev
```
